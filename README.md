# React Router Dom Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom where navigation between routes behaves unexpectedly.  Links may fail to trigger transitions, leading to incorrect route rendering or no change in the displayed route.

The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.  The nature of the bug may involve incorrect usage of `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, or `Link` components; or conflicts with other parts of the application, such as incorrect path definitions or missing context providers.

## To Reproduce

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to launch the application.

## Solution

The provided solution (in `bugSolution.js`) addresses the issue.  The solution might involve:

* Correcting path definitions in the `Route` components.
* Ensuring all necessary context providers (e.g., `BrowserRouter`) are correctly used.
* Resolving conflicts between the routing configuration and other elements of the application.
* Using more robust path matching techniques or resolving issues with query parameters or dynamic segments.
